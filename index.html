            <p class = "Shiba">The Shiba Inu is a Japanese dog what no way! Yes way! These dogs are known to be very loyal.
                There was a story about this dog saving its owner during a disaster. If that isn't loyal, I don't know what is.
                This dog does shed only twice a year, but when it rains it poors. This dog will definitely need to be groomed often.

        <h1 id = "HY">THE HUSKY</h1>

            <p class = "Husky">The husky is a great dog. They are loyal and very friendly. This dog will need to be groomed often especially if 
                the climate is more of the four seasons intsead of just the winter. 
            These dogs would make a great companion.</p>

        <h1 id = "BC"> Border Collie </h1>

            <footer>&#9824;Click on my picture for more of me! </footer>
            <p class = "BorderC">These are very smart dogs. They are able to learn as much as you teach them. 
                How could you not want a dog that will challenge you and is always active. However, if you aren't
                willing to give this dog a lot of attention then they can be a handful as they are very high energy.</p>

        <h1 id = "BE">Beagle </h1>

            <p class = "Beagle">Now these dogs are very loud but in a good way. They are cute and cuddley. Who could say know no
                to this sweet puppy. They are great dogs for hunting. They have the different kinds of bark.
            They sometimes howl when they are bored, or when they are hunting, or trying to communicate with us humans.</p>

        <h1 id = "LR">The Labrador </h1>
            <a href = "https://www.google.com/search?q=labrador+pictures&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi_m-n2s63WAhUD6SYKHeMCB7sQ_AUICigB&biw=681&bih=618">

            <p class = "Labrador"> I have had a black labrador retriever and these dogs are really loyal dogs.
                If you are looking for a family pet then look no further. This dog is great with kids and for learning
            new tricks. However, this breed generally can show signs of hip displacia and sometimes have anxiety about being left alone.
            If you were to consider this type of dog, make sure that someone will be with the dog, otherwise you might want to make your
            house/apartment dog proof. </p>
